GUI loads behind the simulator so sim needs to be moved to the side.

Camera controls are:
	Hold left click and drag to rotate camera
	Hold middle mouse to pan
	Scroll wheel to zoom in and out
 
Toggle options do the following
	Lane Discipline means cars when safe will move to inner lane
	Collision means cars will stop and be marked red when they hit another car
	Slow Down means car will slow down just before hitting another car to avoid a crash
	End of Road means the cars will just stop upon reaching the end of the front road
	Both Roads means instead of teleporting to the back of the road cars will return using the back road
